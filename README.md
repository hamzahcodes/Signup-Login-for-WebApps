Created a Signup and Login feature for webapps which can be used for various websites. Used PHP on server side with MySQL for connection to database. Features like already existing email, not matching of passwords are implemented on registration side and non existince of user in database on Login Side.

Passwords are not stored directly but they are hashed using BlowFish algorithm to secure them from hackers.
